Exercise:

Create a simple web app. Connect to the public Twitter API and display the last 5 public tweets for a username that is entered into an input dialog.

Make sure CSS and HTML is proper and looks decent. The output should show the tweet content, data/time, and a count of how many words are from the English dictionary.

Instructions for running the sample:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt

2. yarn install

3. python api.py to start api

4. yarn start to start front end

5. Browser should open automatically, if not then navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or other port if chosen) in your browser

Reviewing the Code:

Created with create-react-app. The majority of the non-boilerplate (i.e. code that I actually created) can be found in 'api.py', 'src/App.js' and 'src/App.css' and is commented as appropriate.
