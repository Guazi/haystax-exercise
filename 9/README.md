Exercise:

Create a small AngularJS page with input boxes for a user registration page.

The input boxes should collect email address, password, and phone number. Email and password should be required.

Create a validator to make sure the email address and phone number are valid. On pressing a "Register" button the page should thank the user (by name) for registering.

Instructions for running the sample:

1. npm install

2. ng serve

3. Open browser, navigate to http://localhost:4200 (or other port if chosen) in your browser

Reviewing the Code:

Created with angular-cli. The majority of the non-boilerplate (i.e. code that I actually created) can be found in 'src/app/app.component.ts' and 'src/app/app.component.html' and is commented as appropriate.
